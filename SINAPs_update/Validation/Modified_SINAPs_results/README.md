The json files are the output from running the [modified SINAPs script](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/blob/main/SINAPs_update/Detecting_aromatic_interactions.py). 

File "_summary.json" contains the total number of each type of identified aromatic interaction throughout the [leptin's simulation](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/tree/main/SINAPs_update/Simulation_trajectory).

File "_per_step.json" contains type of detected aromatic interaction between a pair of ring-like amino acids in each time step of [leptin simulation trajectory](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/tree/main/SINAPs_update/Simulation_trajectory).
