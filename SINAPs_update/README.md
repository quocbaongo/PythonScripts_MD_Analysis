# Modified SINAPs software


Structural Interaction Network Analysis Protocols (SINAPs) is a Python software developed by Bedart et al. (2022). The primary purpose of this tool is to efficiently identify key molecular interactions throughout protein simulations. The software is publicly available at [at GitHub repository](https://github.com/ParImmune/SINAPs). The original publication describing SINAPs can be accessed [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00854).

The standard workflow involves executing a python script named [SINAPs.py](https://github.com/ParImmune/SINAPs/blob/main/SINAPs/SINAPs.py), which then presents a graphical user interface (GUI) for inputting the simulation trajectory and topology files.

Upon completion, the program outputs a list of all identified interactions and their probabilities of occurrence throughout the simulation, as depicted in the figure below.

While SINAPs effectively identifies potential inter-residue contacts, its exhaustive analysis of all possible interactions can be computationally inefficient, particularly when focusing on specific interaction types.  For example, analyzing only aromatic interaction between a selected pair of amino acids requires the same computational time as analyzing all possible interactions within the researched protein. To address this limitation, the original [SINAPs.py](https://github.com/ParImmune/SINAPs/blob/main/SINAPs/SINAPs.py) script has been modified to enable targeted analysis of aromatic interactions between user-specified amino acid pairs.  The modified script is [Detecting_aromatic_interactions.py](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/blob/main/SINAPs_update/Detecting_aromatic_interactions.py). Users can invoke "python Detecting_aromatic_interactions.py --help" to view instructions on how to use the script. Unlike the original script, which only returns the total number of each type of aromatic interaction formed by a pair of amino acids throughout the simulation, the modified script provides information on the type of aromatic interactions in each structural frame of simulation, and a corresponding plot can be generated using the python script [Plotting_aromatic_interactions.py](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/blob/main/SINAPs_update/Plotting_aromatic_interactions.py).

The [Simulation_trajectory](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/tree/main/SINAPs_update/Simulation_trajectory) directory contains the topology and trajectory files used for validation test.  These files represent a simulation of the human hormone leptin.

The [Validation](https://github.com/quocbaongo/PythonScripts_MD_Analysis/tree/main/SINAPs_update/Validation) directory contains the output generated by both the modified and original scripts for validation purpose.
