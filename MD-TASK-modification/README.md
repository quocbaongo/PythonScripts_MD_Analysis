MD-TASK is a software suite for analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories, and the software is implemented in Python. The program is developed by [Brown et al. (2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5860072/), and the software is freely accessible and modified [here](https://github.com/RUBi-ZA/MD-TASK). One major feature of the software is performing Residue Interaction Network (RIN) analysis. The analysis is conducted using a branch of Mathematics known as graph theory. In a RIN, each amino acid in protein structure is considered as a node in the network. An edge or a connection between two nodes exists if there is an interaction between the two corresponding amino acids.
	
The software constructs protein graphs and conducts subsequent analyses, such as measuring an amino acid's betweenness centrality or average shortest path, sequentially for each structural frame within a time-series trajectory. This sequential approach can be time-consuming for long simulation trajectories (thousands of nanoseconds) involving large molecules (thousands of atoms). Additionally, the analysis output is saved in .dat files, which may not be optimal for handling large, complex arrays. To address these limitations, the original Python scripts for RIN analysis were modified to enable the use of multiple CPUs for parallel processing of multiple structural frames within the trajectory. The output of each frame analysis is now saved in **.h5** files instead of **.dat** files.
